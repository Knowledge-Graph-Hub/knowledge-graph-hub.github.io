Each ontology defines the relationships between concepts, often in hierarchies. If you need to know whether salicylsulfuric acid and fenpicoxamid have anything in common (they're both esters, at least), the CHEBI ontology can help. If you're trying to model the relationships between the cephalopod Enoploteuthis leptura and other species, there's an ontology for that too.</p> <p>Ontologies are carefully designed to define specific relationships and their internal formats reflect this purpose. These formats (often OWL or OBO) are not naturally compatible with knowledge graph assembly. Their classes require translation into nodes and their relationships must be translated into edges, all with a single, consistent format retaining as much of the original ontology's value as possible. It's also preferable to keep track of which version of each ontology is to be used in a KG, for the sake of reproducibility.</p> <p>KG-OBO takes care of this for
