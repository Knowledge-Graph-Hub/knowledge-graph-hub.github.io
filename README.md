# Knowledge Graph Hub: Web Site and Metadata Generation

This repository contains the code for assembling the Knowledge Graph Hub (KG-Hub) web site.

Visit the site at <https://kghub.org/>.

The `utils` directory contains utilities for tracking metadata on all graphs on KG-Hub, with the major KG projects listed in `projects.yaml`.

Graph collections are modeled using [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/linkml). See `utils/models/` for more details.
