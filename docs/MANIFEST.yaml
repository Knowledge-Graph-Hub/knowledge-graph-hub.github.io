    description: CHIRO. CHEBI provides a distinct role hierarchy. Chemicals in the structural
      hierarchy are connected via a 'has role' relation. CHIRO provides links from these
      roles to useful other classes in other ontologies. This will allow direct connection
      between chemical structures (small molecules, drugs) and what they do. This could
      be formalized using 'capable of', in the same way Uberon and the Cell Ontology
      link structures to processes.

    description: FOVT. FuTRES Ontology of Vertebrate Traits is an application ontology
      used to convert vertebrate trait data in spreadsheet to triples. FOVT leverages
      the BioCollections Ontology (BCO) to link observations of individual specimens
      to their trait values. Traits are defined in the Ontology of Biological Attributes
      (OBA).

      a variety of routes, for purposes of public health, environmental monitoring etc,
      stimuli, natural and experimental, any kind of environmental condition or change
      in condition that can be experienced by an organism or population of organisms
      on earth. The scope is very general and can include for example plant treatment
      regimens, as well as human clinical exposures (although these may better be handled
      by a more specialized ontology).
